# TrashBot

A Discord Server bot I made for me and my friends, but even so, written like a real world application.

This bot was made with Discord.js, Typescript, RxJS, Functional Reactive Programming and Dependency Injection with Inversify.

## Install
    npm i

## Watch
    npm run watch

## Run the bot
    npm run start
