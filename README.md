# TrashBot

A Discord Server bot I made for me and my friends, but even so, written like a real world application.

This bot was made with Discord.js, Typescript, RxJS, Functional Reactive Programming and Dependency Injection with Inversify.

It currently needs the [TrashBotAPI](https://github.com/AcePetrucci/TrashBotAPI) to be run alongside it locally, seeing that I've yet to upload them to a cloud server (but at least the DB is on the cloud already).

## Built With
 - Typescript 3.7
 - [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
 - [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com)
 - [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS)

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i
```

## Running the Bot
```bash
# watch
$ npm run watch

# start nodemon
$ npm run start
```
